# Exercise 1: Connect On-Prem Servers to Azure with Arc

Azure Arc extends Azure Resource Manager capabilities to Linux and Windows servers, as well as Kubernetes clusters on any infrastructure across on-premises, multi-cloud, and edge. With Azure Arc, customers can also run Azure data services anywhere, realizing the benefits of cloud innovation, including always up-to-date data capabilities, deployment in seconds (rather than hours), and dynamic scalability on any infrastructure. Azure Arc for servers is currently in public preview.

Task 1: Login and become familiar with Hyper-V Infrastructure

Hyper-V is Microsoft's hardware virtualization product. It lets you create and run a software version of a computer, called a virtual machine. Each virtual machine acts like a complete computer, running an operating system and programs. When you need computing resources, virtual machines give you more flexibility, help save time and money, and are a more efficient way to use hardware than just running one operating system on physical hardware. In this task, you will walk through on-prem environment which is hosted on Hyper-V. You will find three virtual machines hosted on Hyper-V server, which you will onboard to Azure Arc and play around.
